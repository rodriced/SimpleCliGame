This simple terminal-based game is my first Swift project realized for an Openclassrooms iOS developer training.

## Description
The play consists of a fight like those in role games.
There are 2 players. Each player has a team with 3 characters. Each one can be a warrior, an elf or a clerc and has its own characteristics according to its type.
In turn, each player choses a character of his team to either attack a one of the other team or heal one of it's own team.
Game ends when all characters of a team are dead.

## Installing
- Open the project in Xcode
- Run
